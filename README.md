# EcoQuest | Object Oriented Programming
[Jan 2024 - March 2024]

## Brief Description
A 2D educational game built with the LibGDX framework to promote recycling awareness through interactive gameplay. Players collect recyclable items while avoiding non-recyclables, progressing through multiple levels that combine entertainment with environmental education.

## Contributions
Developed the spawning and respawning logic for items, including random spawn positioning, item lifecycle management, and respawn after removal. Implemented item attributes and mechanics, including recyclable/non-recyclable logic and rotating animations for visual engagement. Contributed to asset integration, adding texture images and background frames to enhance game visuals.

## Lessons Learnt
Strengthened understanding of object-oriented programming principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, modularity).Gained hands-on experience with game development frameworks (LibGDX) and integrating animations, assets, and entity lifecycles.

# EcoQuest
Developed by Team 6 (P8).

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a game engine for a dummy game, aiming to demonstrate proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and practical application through the creation of a structured game engine.

## Getting started
Configure run to [DesktopLauncher.java](https://github.com/kxnjo/bomberboys/blob/main/Codes/desktop/src/com/oop/gameengine/DesktopLauncher.java) in the [desktop](https://github.com/kxnjo/bomberboys/tree/main/Codes/desktop) directory.

The game should start running from [SimulationLifeCycleManagement.java](https://github.com/kxnjo/bomberboys/blob/main/Codes/desktop/src/com/oop/gameengine/Managers/SimulationLifeCycleManagement.java).


## Key features to the GameEngine
- Simulation Life Cycle
- Scene Management
- Entity Management
- AI Control Management
- Player Control Management
- Collision Management
- Input Output Management
